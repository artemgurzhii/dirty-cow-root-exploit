## List of files

### main.c
This is our main file with all the source code and all magic is happening here.

### main.h
This is our main file with all the functions and constants for the main file. When you make the rules prog (well, or simply not shit), this file must be present, where we write the notation for all functions (which arguments are accepted, what are called and which types are returned)
We also denote constants and all such shit that prog needs.

### Makefile
This file is used to work with the project. All commands start with `make`.
In this file there are the following commands:
  - `main` - does the compilation of the project
  - `zip` - if you suddenly need to submit a project in zip format (archive) then just call` main zip` and it will do everything, make the project archive, but only those files that are needed
  - `clean` - cleans the project of unnecessary files, namely it deletes the` main` and the backup of passwords (`/ tmp / passwd.bak`)

That is, the call of commands looks like this:
  - `make clean` - clean the project from shit
  - `make zip` - will prepare the project for delivery, if you want to upload it in the archive format
  - `make main` - the project will be rebuilt (it will make the binary run)

Also, a small note, `make` is the smallest clever one, and by default executes` make all` command, which in turn executes `make main`, and so for compilation we can write 3 options:` make`, `make all` or `make main`.

If suddenly the console curses (writes sho you fools, etc.), try to run `make clean`, it may be because the binary already exists, or already there is a file with backups
